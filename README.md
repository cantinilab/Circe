## Description
This repo contains a python package for inferring **co-accessibility networks from single-cell ATAC-seq data**, using [skggm](https://www.github.com/skggm/skggm) for the graphical lasso and [scanpy](https://www.github.com/theislab/scanpy) for data processing.

It is based on the pipeline and hypotheses presented in the manuscript "Cicero Predicts cis-Regulatory DNA Interactions from Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility Data" by Pliner et al. (2018). This R package [Cicero](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cicero-release/) is available [here](https://www.github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/cicero-release).

<br> Metacalls computation might create differences, but scores will be identical applied to the same metacalls (cf comparison plots below). It should run significantly faster than Cicero _(e.g.: running time of 5 sec instead of 17 min for the dataset 2)_.

_If you have any suggestion, don't hesitate ! This package is still a work in progress :)_


## Installation
The package can be installed using pip:

```
pip install circe-py
```

 and from github
```
pip install "git+https://github.com/cantinilab/circe.git"
```
*Warning: If you clone the repo, don't stay in the repo to run your script because python will import the non-compiled cython file (probable error: circe.pyquic does not have a quic function)*

## Minimal example
```
import anndata as ad
import circe as ci

# Load the data
atac = ad.read_h5ad('atac_data.h5ad')
atac = ci.add_region_infos(atac)

# Compute the co-accessibility network
ci.compute_atac_network(atac)

# Extract the network and find CCANs modules
circe_network = ci.extract_atac_links(atac)
ccans_module = ci.find_ccans(atac)
```
### Visualisation
```
ci.plot_connections(
    adata,
    chromosome="chr1",
    start=1e7,
    end=1.3e7
```

## Comparison to Cicero R package
<br> *On the same metacells obtained from Cicero code.*

All tests can be found in the [circe benchmark repo](https://github.com/r-trimbour/circe_benchmark/)

### Real dataset 2 - subsample of 10x PBMC (2021)
- Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.999958
- Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.999911
<img src="https://github.com/cantinilab/circe/raw/main/Figures/correlation_real_dataset2.png" align="center" width="480"/>

Performance on real dataset 2:
- Runtime: ~100x faster
- Memory usage: ~5x less

### Coming:

- ~~_**Calculate metacells !**_~~
- ~~_Add stats on similarity on large datasets._~~
- ~~_Add stats on runtime, memory usage._~~
- _Implement the multithreading use. Should speed up even more._
- ~~_Fix seed for reproducibility._~~

## Usage
It is currently developped to work with AnnData objects. Check Example1.ipynb for a simple usage example.
